This is a quiz that tests your coding knowledge

## Project Description
This is a quiz that is created to to be a series of questions with a set of buttons tha is the answers.
This used dynamic Javascript to execute most of the elements of the page.  The header being the only static thing that is in the HTML.

Challenges:  
-for loops behaved weird and my original design was two for loops in a function. but the outer for loop continued executing while other code didn't complete and caused innumerable errors.  
-the scoreboard aswell wreaked havoc with the time Interval function causing the clearInterval not to be read. 
-I abandoned the High Score element of the quiz because of the lateness of the project.
